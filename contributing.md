## How to contribute to Join the Table

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead  [email](mailto:hello@ambermjones.dev). After the initial reply to your report, I will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement. 

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/amberjones/JoinTheTable-mobile/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/amberjones/JoinTheTable-mobile/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Join the Table will generally not be accepted (read a great explanation on [this rationale by Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700)).

#### **Do you want to suggest new feature or change an existing one?**

Awesome! 
* Suggest your change as a GitHub issue and provide the following information:
  - **A clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
  - Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
  - Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
  - **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Join the Table codebase?**

This app is worked on in my spare time. I encourage you to pitch in and join the table ..er effort!

* Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.


Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
